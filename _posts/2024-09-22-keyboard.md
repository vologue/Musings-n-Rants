# Keyboard

I finally got myself a mechanical keyboard. While this is most definitely not the best keyboard in the
market, it is a good keyboard to start my mechanical keyboard journey.

I went ahead and bought a keyboard from a company I had never heard about, without looking at YouTube reviews.
To be fair I did look at the Amazon reviews which of course can be faked. But it looks like I ended with a
keyboard which has

- Red switches meaning I can be unapologetically annoying at work.
- Interchangeable keycaps.
- Hot-swappable keys (Or at least that's what it says in the manual)
- Lets me connect to my devices using Bluetooth and a wifi adapter.
- It is pretty compact and easy to carry.
- looks pretty and and ahs a retro look.

I'm sincerely hoping this pushes me to work on more side projects and write more in general.
