It has been a childhood dream of mine to make a song and it has finally happened.

I Proudly present my song Night's Solace.

This song is about the joy that comes with acceptance. 
The acceptance that comes after a long period of pain.
Or in Millenial: The feeling of being able to say `It is what it is`.

It isn't much, the production quality is low but, I still sincerely hope it helps you 
- Sleep
- Process stuff
- Accept reality and move forward
