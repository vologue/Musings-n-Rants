Hi, I'm Raghav. I'm a software engineer, living in bangalore, India. I like building systems, and I'm currently attempting to build one to solve config management and delivery.

Reach out to me to chat about distributed systems, code, music and running at <raghav.sp98@gmail.com>/<raghav.pillai@vologue.dev>

In my free time I play the piano (western classical), run and sometimes read.
