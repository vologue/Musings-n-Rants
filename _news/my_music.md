It has been a childhood dream of mine to make a song and it has finally happened.

I Proudly present my song Night's Solace.

<audio src="/assets/audio/nights-solace.mp3" controls preload></audio>

This song is about the joy that comes with acceptance.
The acceptance that comes after a long period of pain.
Or in Millenial: The feeling of being able to say `It is what it is`.

It isn't much, the production quality is low but, I still sincerely hope it helps you
- Sleep
